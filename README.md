# The Bookstore Project

## Description

I am currently learning PHP 7 using the book _Learning PHP 7_ by Antonio Lopez. This is the code along project of this book.
So I will be updating this project along my reading and understanding of the PHP 7 concepts, covering OOP, Database, MVC, Frameworks, Testing and Rest API's.

The project consit of creating a books store application, but I think you probably figured that out yourself!
